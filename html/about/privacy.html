<h2>Data you directly provide</h2>
<p>
    Data that you directly provide to the website for the purposes of publishing

<h2>Data you passively provide</h2>
<p>
    When you request any resource from this website (for example, a page, a font, an image, or an API endpoint)
    the requested URL (without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Structure">query string parameters</a>)
    is stored in the site's database and its hit count is incremented by one.
    The database table only stores the number of hits each resource has received.
    No information about individual requests is stored.
    You can see the first few rows of this database table here: <a href="/api/hits">/api/hits</a>
